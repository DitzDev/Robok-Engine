# Security Policy for 3D Game Creation Engine

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the security practices and policies for a 3D game creation engine developed with Jetpack Compose. The goal of this policy is to ensure the security of both the engine and the games developed using it, protecting developers, users, and their data.

## 2. Security Objectives
- Protect the integrity of the game engine and prevent unauthorized modifications.
- Ensure data confidentiality and integrity for developers and end-users.
- Protect games created with the engine from vulnerabilities.
- Establish a secure environment for asset management, coding, and distribution.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all components of the 3D game creation engine, including:
- Jetpack Compose UI and game development components.
- Game assets (models, textures, scripts, etc.).
- User data (game save files, configuration files, etc.).
- Any APIs or external services integrated with the engine.

## 4. Secure Coding Practices
- **Input Validation**: All input data (e.g., user input, API responses) should be validated to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Developers must implement proper authentication mechanisms to secure game assets, access to sensitive game development features, and user data.
  - Use OAuth2 or similar standards for third-party integrations.
  - Ensure user credentials are stored securely using hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2).
- **Least Privilege**: Code should be written following the principle of least privilege, ensuring that each component only has the access necessary for its function.
- **Dependencies Management**: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools like Dependabot to automate dependency checking.
- **Secure Game Logic**: Game logic that affects critical game mechanics (e.g., multiplayer interactions) should be protected from client-side tampering by validating actions on a secure server.
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data such as user credentials, game save files, and configuration settings should be encrypted both in transit and at rest, using strong encryption standards (e.g., AES-256).

## 5. Data Protection
- **Personal Data Protection**: Any personal data (such as usernames, emails, and profiles) collected or processed should comply with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
  - Users should have the option to manage their personal data and request deletion as necessary.
- **Anonymization**: Personal identifiers should be anonymized wherever possible to mitigate risks in case of a data breach.
- **Secure Backups**: Regular backups should be created for critical user and game data. These backups must be securely encrypted and stored to prevent unauthorized access.

## 6. Asset Security
- **Code Integrity**: Verify the integrity of game assets (e.g., models, textures) using checksums or digital signatures to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- **Licensing Compliance**: Ensure that all assets (e.g., third-party libraries, soundtracks) are properly licensed, and that developers have the necessary permissions to distribute them.
- **Access Control**: Limit access to sensitive assets, including game source code, to authorized personnel only.

## 7. Secure Distribution
- **Signed Executables**: Games and game engine updates should be digitally signed to ensure the authenticity of the content distributed to end-users.
- **Versioning and Updates**: Implement secure versioning and distribution of the game engine and games developed with it, using trusted repositories or platforms. Update channels should be protected against tampering.
- **Patch Management**: Promptly address security vulnerabilities and release patches when issues are identified.

## 8. Incident Response
- **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring of game engine activities to detect security incidents. Logs should be protected and regularly reviewed.
- **Incident Handling**: Have a clear incident response plan in place to handle security breaches or vulnerabilities. This includes communication channels, remediation procedures, and timelines for addressing issues.

## 9. Developer and User Education
- **Security Awareness**: Provide security training and documentation to developers using the engine. Encourage the adoption of secure development practices.
- **User Guidelines**: Offer guidelines for end-users on how to protect their data and devices while using games developed with the engine (e.g., avoiding untrusted mods or plugins).

## 10. Compliance and Audits
- **Security Audits**: Regular security audits should be conducted on the game engine to identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with this policy.
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure compliance with relevant legal frameworks, including data protection laws, software distribution regulations, and intellectual property laws.
