# Robok

Robok is a programming language that enhances Java, making it easier and simpler, while also adding features that Java does not have. If you are familiar with Java, you will feel at home with Robok but will enjoy a cleaner syntax and new features that facilitate development.

## Features

- **Simplified Syntax**: Robok maintains the familiarity of Java but with a more concise and less verbose syntax.
- **New Functionalities**: Features not present in standard Java, providing more flexibility and power to the developer.
- **Dedicated IDE**: Robok comes with its own IDE for Android, making it easy to compile and develop in the new language.
